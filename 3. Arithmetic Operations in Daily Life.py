# Objective:
# The aim of this assignment is to get familiarized with basic arithmetic operations and understand how they can be applied in everyday situations.

# Task 1: Grocery Store Math
# Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic

bread, peanut_butter, jelly=5.99,4.99, 4.50
total_cost=bread+peanut_butter+jelly
print(total_cost)

# Task 2: Bank Interest
# If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year. So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.
savings_account,interest_rate=10000,.07
end_of_year_amount=savings_account+(savings_account*interest_rate)
print(end_of_year_amount)
